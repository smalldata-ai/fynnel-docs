# Workspaces

A workspace in Fynnel is a logical container that organizes and isolates all the resources, configurations, and assets required for a specific context. Workspaces enable teams to ensure clean separation and easier management of data workflows.

## Key Aspects of a Fynnel Workspace
### **Isolation and Organizatio:** 
Workspaces provide a boundary for resources such as connections, pipelines, and configurations. This isolation allows users to:
- Manage different clients or business units independently
- Avoid conflicts between unrelated data projects
### **Resource Management**
Each workspace maintains its own set of:
- Data connections (e.g., to databases, cloud storage, APIs)
- Pipeline definitions and schedules
- Transformation logic and metadata
- Configuration files and secrets

### **Collaboration and Access Control**
Workspaces facilitate collaboration by allowing teams to work within a shared context. They can also be used to implement access controls, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify resources within a workspace.

### **Integration with Projects and Pipelines**
Pipelines are typically scoped within a workspace. This means that all pipeline executions, schedules, and logs are associated with a specific workspace, making it easier to track and manage data operations.

### **Lifecycle Operations**
Fynnel provides CLI commands to create, list, update, and delete workspaces. This makes it easy to spin up new environments, migrate resources, or decommission obsolete workspaces as needed.

#### Create a Workspace
Purpose: Initialize a new workspace with its own configuration and resource scope.
```bash
fynnel workspaces create --name=my_workspace
```
---

#### Delete a Workspace
Purpose: Remove a workspace and all its associated resources.
```bash
fynnel workspaces delete --name=my_workspace
```
---

#### List all associated
Purpose: View all existing workspaces managed by this project.
```bash
fynnel workspaces list
```
